		I am a dedicated C++/C# programmer and game developer. I have experience developing games in both Unity and Unreal Engine 4. 
		Driven and passionate to learn new concepts and technologies, I aim to further my skills and help contribute to the ever 
		growing industry and artform of game development.

	 <p>
		Currently I am employed at Simutech Multimedia, where I operate under the role of Game Developer. At Simutech,
		my main responsibility is programming dynamic simulations within Unity for use as training software in the field of 
		electrical engineering.

		In my spare time I've been working on a solo project, Twilight's Call: A Hollow Heart.
		A Tactical JRPG, Twilight's Call is a turn-based strategy game inspired by works such as Disgaea, 
		Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem. Incorporating grid-based movement and light deck building elements, 
		Twilight's Call places an emphasis on unit placement and territory management to create an engaging gameplay loop 
		in which reclaimed map space can be used to both you and your enemy's advantage.
