        Twilight's Call is a turn-based RPG inspired by the likes of Final Fantasy and Okage Shadow King. Developed over the course of Summer 2018, Twilight's Call was meant to serve as a way for Stefano and I to prepare and discipline ourselves 
		for our third and final year of Game Development. This included testing our ability to meet deadlines, follow game design best practices, and collaborate in an effective manner, all while building a game from the ground up without the 
		guidance one would find in a classroom. After 4 months of development, we set aside Twilight's Call to focus on our college capstone project, Fallen Night, happy with what we were able to achieve.
		After graduating from Game Development, we decided to return to Twilight's Call to see what we could do with it given our newfound skills.
	</p>
	<p>
		Twilights Call A Hollow Heart is the final offical name that we gave it. The genre that we decided on was to try to convert
		Twilights Call to be a Tactics game like francises such as Fire Emblem and Disgaea. This took major refractoring to a bunch
		of fundamental scripts for the better.
	 </p>
	  
	 
	 <p>
		The unique selling points of the game were that all the walkable
		ground in the game can be manipulated for the player or enemys gain. This system is called Domain each character 
		that is playable has there own unique Domain and can paint the world in there own color. For Example the main character Sigma
		uses the Domain ability Patchwork Chimera to steal the the Domain ability of anyone within his Domain.This brings great tactical
		weight to the game and now every step you take is a puzzle that needs to be thought about.
	 
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
		Another unique point for the game is the Memoria system. When a enemy dies they leave behind their memorys and skills signified by
		a floating blue soul called Memoria. When a character walks ontop of the Memoria they will get a choice out of 3 skills the enemy had
		to be used in battle.
	 
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
		Twilights Call a Hollow Heart is still in development but please look forward to any future updates.

     <p>
        Simultech Multimedia is a company that creates, a newly found genre of Video Games called "Serious Games". 
		Serious Games are Video Games used to train professionals in certain skills.
		The specific industry that Simultech Multimedia targets is Electrical Engineering.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
        The way the simulations act, is no different then a point and click puzzle game.
		Each object in the scene communicates with a solver that does all the complex math calculations 
		and funnels events to the unity end.
		Once we receive these events we can then accurates display to the user what they wish to get.
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		I learned alot about how the project was being handled in the first few months
		and how I could optimize the workflow and make it more effcient.
		The biggest problem was every product they wanted to sell was a different unity project, and 
		each one had its own codebase. I designed a simple system called "Marble", In Marble was a 
		git repository that contained every single common script in it that when pushed, would change 
		everything you just pushed into every single project.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		My Second big workflow optimization was between me and the Lead 3D Artist. Before I came every time
		a project used a same component they would just recreate the entire thing every single time. The work 
		around I figured out was to have every asset be in its own folder with its Material, Mesh,Prefab. 
		Then I used Unity's Asset Packaging system to pack everything together in single Package Asset.
		Now whenever the Lead Artist needs to add in a button for example it will have everything already
		attached with it.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		Overall working on this project has allowed me, to grow by giving me a large amount of responsbility from the begining.
		Now with the fixes to the workflow and my own programming skill getting better it is much easier to rapidly produce content.

      <p>
      Third Year project developed using the Unity engine by a group of 9 people including myself.
	  Tasked with making a functional game over the length of 4 releases and 22, 2 week sprints I helped create the game called Fallen Knight.
	  Fallen knight is a first person action boss rush game with large inspiriations form the Dark souls games.
	  During the course of development I had to wear alot of hats in order to meet the dead lines.
	  </p>
	  
	  
	  <p>
      As a Gameplay Programmer I created intricate boss Ai. The bosses were designed with a giant state machine of the actions they will execute
	  and a complex web of when they would accomplish those actions.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
      As Graphics Programmer I created many unique shaders to breath life into the game.The most developed of the shaders was a water shader
	  that moved and when it intersected with anything it would give a white rim along the intercetion area. 
	  
	  <p>
      As a Level Designer I helped to design every level in the game. Using illustrator I would create a quick mockup of the level and hand it
	  to the artists to create art assets. After the assets were done I would help place every object in the game
	  </p>
	  
	  
	 <p>
      Fallen Knight was a great project to work on that helped me grow as a programmer and as a person. Communicating with a large group of 
	  people with hierarchy was a challenge but in the end we persisted and created a great work that we can all be proud of.

        During my third year of college I worked at Expired Games as a Contract Programmer for the length of 4 months.
		I was hired to help out on development of the game Nova Knights a hack and slash beatum up similar to games like River City girls
		and Castle Crashers.
	 </p>
	
	 <p>
        During the 4 months I helped out to modify old code and to create new code from scratch. The largest responsibility I had was to 
		create a modular dialogue system that could be changed to suit the scene. I created a bunch of generic triggers that when finished
		would send a Json file to the dialogue manager. When recieved the dialogue manager would parse different aspects of the file such as
		portraits,Fonts and the text itself.
	</p>
	
	 <p>
        Overall working with Expired Games was a great experince and I am happy they gave so much responsibility to a student.

       Twilights Call is a Turnbased strategy game Created by me and my partner Stefano Pinto over the summer of 2018.
	   I did all of the code for the game and my partner made all the models. In the game you can cast a large amount of spells. 
	   Each one has an elemental type, each creature has an elemental Strength and Weakness. 
	   In order to beat the game you need to exploit the weaknesses of the enemys.
