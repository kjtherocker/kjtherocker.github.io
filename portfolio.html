     <p>
        Simultech Multimedia is a company that creates, a newly found genre of Video Games called "Serious Games". 
		Serious Games are Video Games used to train professionals in certain skills.
		The specific industry that Simultech Multimedia targets is Electrical Engineering.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
        The way the simulations act, is no different then a point and click puzzle game.
		Each object in the scene communicates with a solver that does all the complex math calculations 
		and funnels events to the unity end.
		Once we receive these events we can then accurates display to the user what they wish to get.
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		I learned alot about how the project was being handled in the first few months
		and how I could optimize the workflow and make it more effcient.
		The biggest problem was every product they wanted to sell was a different unity project, and 
		each one had its own codebase. I designed a simple system called "Marble", In Marble was a 
		git repository that contained every single common script in it that when pushed, would change 
		everything you just pushed into every single project.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		My Second big workflow optimization was between me and the Lead 3D Artist. Before I came every time
		a project used a same component they would just recreate the entire thing every single time. The work 
		around I figured out was to have every asset be in its own folder with its Material, Mesh,Prefab. 
		Then I used Unity's Asset Packaging system to pack everything together in single Package Asset.
		Now whenever the Lead Artist needs to add in a button for example it will have everything already
		attached with it.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		Overall working on this project has allowed me, to grow by giving me a large amount of responsbility from the begining.
		Now with the fixes to the workflow and my own programming skill getting better it is much easier to rapidly produce content.

     <p>
        Twilight's CallI is a turn-based RPG inspired by the likes of Fire Emblem and Okage: Shadow King. Developed over the course of Summer 2018, Twilight's Call was meant to serve as a way for Stefano and I to prepare and discipline ourselves 
		for our third and final year of Game Development. This included testing our ability to meet deadlines, follow game design best practices, and collaborate in an effective manner, all while building a game from the ground up without the 
		guidance one would find in a classroom. After 4 months of development, we set aside Twilight's Call to focus on our college capstone project, Fallen Night, happy with what we were able to achieve.
		After graduating from Game Development, we decided to return to Twilight's Call to see what we could do with it given our newfound skills, a "remaster" as we jokingly called it. This is the result.
	</p>
	<p>
		Development on the game is still in progress but with balancing a full time job there is only so much time that can be dedicated to development.

       Twilights Call is a Turnbased strategy game Created by me and my partner Stefano Pinto over the summer of 2018. I did all of the code for the game and my partner made all the models. In the game you can cast a large amount of spells. Each one has an elemental type, each creature has an elemental Strength and Weakness. In order to beat the game you need to exploit the weaknesses of the enemys.

      <p>
      Third Year project developed using the Unity engine by a group of 9 people including myself. Tasked with making a functional game over the length of 4 releases and 22 sprints I helped create the game called Fallen Knight. I handled both the role of the Level Designer and General Programmer. As a general programmer I coded the entire tutorial and half of our toad boss, Odell the Abomination state machine based Ai system Along side Timothy Hood.I also Coded unique water Shader Effects. As a Level designer I placed every single object that is in the game but I also created all of the particle effects in the game such as FireFlys, Fog, and Green Fire.
