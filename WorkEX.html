     <p>
        Simultech Multimedia is a company that creates, a newly found genre of Video Games called "Serious Games". 
		Serious Games are Video Games used to train professionals in certain skills.
		The specific industry that Simultech Multimedia targets is Electrical Engineering.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
        The way the simulations act, is no different then a point and click puzzle game.
		Each object in the scene communicates with a solver that does all the complex math calculations 
		and funnels events to the unity end.
		Once we receive these events we can then accurates display to the user what they wish to get.
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		I learned alot about how the project was being handled in the first few months
		and how I could optimize the workflow and make it more effcient.
		The biggest problem was every product they wanted to sell was a different unity project, and 
		each one had its own codebase. I designed a simple system called "Marble", In Marble was a 
		git repository that contained every single common script in it that when pushed, would change 
		everything you just pushed into every single project.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		My Second big workflow optimization was between me and the Lead 3D Artist. Before I came every time
		a project used a same component they would just recreate the entire thing every single time. The work 
		around I figured out was to have every asset be in its own folder with its Material, Mesh,Prefab. 
		Then I used Unity's Asset Packaging system to pack everything together in single Package Asset.
		Now whenever the Lead Artist needs to add in a button for example it will have everything already
		attached with it.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
     
		Overall working on this project has allowed me, to grow by giving me a large amount of responsbility from the begining.
		Now with the fixes to the workflow and my own programming skill getting better it is much easier to rapidly produce content.

      <p>
        During my third year of college I worked at Expired Games as a Contract Programmer for the length of 4 months.
		I was hired to help out on development of the game Nova Knights a hack and slash beatum up similar to games like River City girls
		and Castle Crashers.
	 </p>
	
	 <p>
        During the 4 months I helped out to modify old code and to create new code from scratch. The largest responsibility I had was to 
		create a modular dialogue system that could be changed to suit the scene. I created a bunch of generic triggers that when finished
		would send a Json file to the dialogue manager. When recieved the dialogue manager would parse different aspects of the file such as
		portraits,Fonts and the text itself.
	</p>
	
	 <p>
        Overall working with Expired Games was a great experince and I am happy they gave so much responsibility to a student.
